\title{Calculate Cohen's w Effect Size}
\usage{
cohen.w(chi_sq, n)
}
\arguments{
\item{chi_sq}{Numeric value of the chi-square statistic}

\item{n}{Integer representing the total sample size}
}
\value{
Returns a numeric value representing Cohen's w effect size.
The interpretation guidelines are:
* 0.1: small effect
* 0.3: medium effect
* 0.5: large effect
}
\description{
Calculates Cohen's w, which is a measure of effect size used for chi-square tests
of goodness of fit and contingency tables. It measures the discrepancy between 
observed and expected proportions.
}
\details{
Cohen's w is calculated as the square root of (chi-square / N), where N is the
total sample size. This effect size is particularly useful for chi-square tests
as it provides a standardized measure of effect that is independent of sample size.
}
\examples{
# For a chi-square value of 10 with 100 observations
cohen.w(chi_sq = 10, n = 100)

# For a chi-square value of 25 with 200 observations
cohen.w(chi_sq = 25, n = 200)
