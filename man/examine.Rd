\title{Perform Descriptive Statistical Analysis}
\usage{
examine(data, x = NULL, all.results = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or vector containing the variables to analyze}

\item{x}{Optional. Specific variable(s) to analyze. If NULL, analyzes all numeric variables}

\item{all.results}{Logical. If TRUE, displays extended set of statistics. Default is FALSE}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Prints a formatted summary for each analyzed variable containing:
  \itemize{
    \item Basic information: total observations, valid cases, missing cases
    \item Basic statistics: mean, trimmed mean, median, standard deviation
    \item Distribution measures: skewness, kurtosis (with significance indicators)
    \item When all.results=TRUE, additional statistics include:
      \itemize{
        \item 95% confidence intervals
        \item Variance
        \item Range
        \item IQR (Interquartile Range)
      }
  }
}
\description{
Calculates and displays comprehensive descriptive statistics for numeric variables
in a dataset. Statistics include measures of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution shape.
}
\details{
The function automatically handles missing values and provides standard errors
for skewness and kurtosis. Significance of non-normal distribution is indicated
with asterisks (*) when the absolute value of skewness or kurtosis divided by
their respective standard errors exceeds 2.
}
\examples{
# Examine all numeric variables in a dataset
examine(mtcars)

# Examine specific variables
examine(mtcars, x = mtcars$mpg)

# Get extended statistics
examine(mtcars, all.results = TRUE)
