\title{Perform Comprehensive Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)}
\usage{
ANOVA(data, dv, formula, type = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables for analysis}

\item{dv}{Character string specifying the dependent variable}

\item{formula}{A formula object specifying the ANOVA design. For repeated measures,
the within-subjects factors should be on the right side of the ~}

\item{type}{Numeric value specifying the type of sum of squares to use (default = 2)}
}
\value{
A list object of class "ANOVA" containing:
  \item{fit}{The fitted linear model object}
  \item{idata}{Data frame containing the within-subjects factor levels}
  \item{wdata}{The data in wide format}
  \item{full.analysis}{Complete Anova results}
  \item{results}{List containing univariate and multivariate results}
  \item{sphericity.test}{Mauchly's test of sphericity (for repeated measures)}
  \item{sphericity.correction}{Sphericity corrections (Greenhouse-Geisser and Huynh-Feldt)}
}
\description{
This function performs a comprehensive Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) that handles both univariate
and multivariate designs. It provides detailed statistics including effect sizes and sphericity tests
for repeated measures designs.
}
\details{
The function calculates:
* Partial eta-squared (etaSqP)
* Eta-squared (etaSq)
* Omega-squared (omegaSq)
* F-values and p-values
* Sphericity tests for repeated measures designs
}
\examples{
# Between-subjects ANOVA
ANOVA(data = mydata, dv = "score", formula = ~ group)

# Repeated measures ANOVA
ANOVA(data = mydata, dv = "score", formula = subject ~ time)

# Mixed ANOVA
ANOVA(data = mydata, dv = "score", formula = subject + group ~ time)
