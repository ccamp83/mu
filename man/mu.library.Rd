\description{
This function checks if requested packages are installed, installs missing ones,
and loads all requested packages into the R environment. It simplifies package
management by handling both installation and loading in a single function call.
}
\details{
The function performs three main steps:
1. Checks which requested packages are already installed
2. Installs any missing packages from CRAN
3. Loads all requested packages using require()

Packages are installed with dependencies from the cloud.r-project.org repository.

\examples{
# Load a single package
mu.library("dplyr")

mu.library(c("ggplot2", "tidyr", "readr"))
