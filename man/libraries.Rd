This function manages package dependencies for the ShapeLab package. It checks for required packages,
installs missing ones, optionally updates existing packages, and loads them into the R environment.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Checks currently installed packages
2. Compares against required package list
3. Installs any missing packages from CRAN
4. Optionally updates all packages
5. Optionally loads all required packages

Required packages include:
* Data manipulation: plyr
* Visualization: ggplot2, cowplot, grid, grDevices, lattice
* Statistical analysis: lme4, car, AICcmodavg, fpc
